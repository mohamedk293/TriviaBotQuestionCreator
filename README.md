# Trivia Bot Question Creator

### What problem does this solve?
Originally, I had used a CLI tool made in Python to generate questions for my trivia bot for Discord using Discord's python libraries. However, I realized that this CLI tool was inefficient and wanted to streamline the question creation process. I was interested in learning TypeScript and React, so I decided to made a web application that has a more friendly user experience with a dedicated GUI while also allowing me to export the question data in JSON by copying the JSON data into the clipboard.
This was my first time learning React and TypeScript, so expect some bad code. :)

### How to run?
You can use `npm run dev` to start a localhost server.

### Features to be added
- Deleting a question off the question list.
- Importing JSON data to make even more questions!
- Refactoring, refactoring, and more refactoring... (help)
- More features that I have not listed here __once the time comes!__
